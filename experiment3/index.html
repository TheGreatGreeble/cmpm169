			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods: L-system Snake</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>I wanted to explore L-systems, some light googling brought me to a tutorial, linked at the bottom of the page, by Greg Gelong. It creates a simple L-system in a feather-like shape.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>wanted to make crom cruach</p>
				<p>made circle</p>
				<p>made perlin noise background like in pic</p>
				<p>made L-system go straight across instead to fill space (also easier)</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>first I started trying to get a twisting pattern to emerge from the snake</p>
				<p>Twisting pattern should never rotate more then 90 degrees</p>
				<p>setup some basic rules for the sentence structure, and added some random variation to make it look more natural</p>
				<p>twisting causes it to shrink</p>
				<p>compensated for snake length by extending certain sections when needed</p>
				<p>compensation was over compensating</p>
				<p>messed around with compensation until it was acceptable length</p>
				<p>then moved on to vertical compensation</p>
				<p>then made it look more like crom cruach by making 2 lines of differing strokelengths</p>
				<p>et viola</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<p>everything</p>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<p>I wanted to make it as close to the crom cruach in the movie as possible. In the end it didn't come out looking quite like it, but I'm happy with it none the less. I had never heard about L-Systems before this class, but I really like them. I'm glad I learned how they worked, it was fun to play with their logic</p>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<p>I was really sad that I couldn't get the endless twisting around itself like in the movie, but I when considering implimentation and L-Systems, I just couldn't think of a way to do it that wouldn't make way more work for myself then I could commit to.</p>
					<p>I'm really happy with the variation of the twists I got. At first I was having a hard time figuring out how to adhere to my own rules for how I wanted it to look, but it was a really interesting problem to solve. I had a lot of fun doing it, and seeing it twist in weird ways across the screen was really cool to accomplish.</p>
