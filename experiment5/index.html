				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>I started with a sketch by <a url="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1916460">Carlos Mendes</a> that setup a simple solar system with moving spheres.</p>
				<p>after a bit of setup and a changing of textures, I got it up on my webpage and ready to mess around with it</p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>The script I started with had a very nice class structure, but the movement was very simple, and I wanted to be able to move in different ways. so I setup a new class called starParticle, and represented its velocity, current position, and destination as vectors, so that 3d movement math could be done easier.</p>
				<p>it took me a while but I got the star/particle to move towards a given destination, by lerping it's velocity to move closer to the given destination.</p>
				<p>I didn't quite know what I was making yet, but I knew I wanted the particles and movement to have some connection to the scene. so I added a <a url="https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/various/various-models/book-open-blank">3d book model</a> into the scene, with the idea that I could have the stars/particles flying out of the book.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>With the ability to mke the particles fly towards a given point I started trying to make the movement a little less linear A to B. At first I wanted to make a continuous stream of particles fly out of the book, however in messing with the movement towards the endpoint I accidentally made the particle kind of jitter around as it moved towards destination, and I thought it looked very interesting. I started updating the destination every frame and pretty soon had a particle orbiting around in a jittering motion that reminded me of some kind of atomic particle.</p>
				<p>I added more of these particles all going towards the same moving destination and I liked it's odd movement patterns. I wanted to add some kind of tail tracing the movement of each particle. I landed on the idea of not redrawing the background every frame, this way all the past frame renders of the particles would remain, and leave a trace of its movement.</p>
				<p>I made a new class that contained many of these particles, and a specific destination point for them, this way I could have multiple of these particle groups all flying around.</p>
				<p>I wanted to give each particle a little more contrast, and after a lot of fiddling with the color and lighting, I was able to give each particle it's own color, and a light soure to shine on them in the middle where the book sits.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
				</ul>
				<p>this was a solo project. </p>
