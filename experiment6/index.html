			<h1>Experiment 6 - Text: Emotional Ecology</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>started with code that distorts text</p>
				<p>code was very confusing so I ended up barely using it</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>thought it would be cool if you could spawn more text that would dissabate different colors</p>
				<p>first step was getting text on the screen, bit more work then I thought</p>
				<p>to keep adding text I made a seperate new img that I could repeatedly redraw to the screen with the same text</p>
				<p>Added buttons to add the text</p>
				<p>changed color of the text</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>Now I wanted to make the text spread their color</p>
				<p>made each pixel spread its highest colors</p>
				<p>messed around with this for a while getting different results</p>
				<p>eventually found this one where love overtakes hate, which overtakes hungy, which overtakes love, which resulted in a really cool ecology of these emotions mixing and fighting eachother.</p>
				<p>changed hate and hungy to anger and hunger</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<p>everything</p>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<p>working with that original code turned out to be a lot more difficult for what I wanted to do. Really liked the end result, looks legitimatly better then I initially thought it would.</p>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<p>I didn't spend enough time on it and had to turn it in late which I hate doing. had to lower pixel density to make it barable to run.</p>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<button id="Love"  type="button">Add Love</button>
				<button id="Hate"  type="button">Add Anger</button>
				<button id="Hungy"  type="button">Add Hunger</button>
				<button id="GoTime"  type="button">Start/Stop</button>
				<button id="Reset"  type="button">Reset</button>
